# Contributing to OpenShell

OpenShell is built agent-first. We design systems and use agents to implement them. Your agent is your first collaborator — point it at this repo before opening issues, asking questions, or submitting code.

## Before You Open an Issue

This project ships with [agent skills](#agent-skills-for-contributors) that can diagnose problems, explore the codebase, generate policies, and walk you through common workflows. Before filing an issue:

1. Clone the repo and point your coding agent at it.
2. Load the relevant skill - `debug-openshell-cluster` for cluster problems, `debug-inference` for inference setup problems, `openshell-cli` for usage questions, `generate-sandbox-policy` for policy help.
3. Have your agent investigate. Let it run diagnostics, read the architecture docs, and attempt a fix.
4. If the agent cannot resolve it, open an issue **with the agent's diagnostic output attached**. The issue template requires this.

### When to Open an Issue

- A real bug that your agent confirmed and could not fix.
- A feature proposal with a design — not a "please build this" request.
- An infrastructure problem that the `debug-openshell-cluster` skill could not resolve.
- An inference setup problem that the `debug-inference` skill could not resolve.
- Security vulnerabilities must follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — **not** GitHub issues.

### When NOT to Open an Issue

- Questions about how things work — your agent can answer these from the codebase and architecture docs.
- Configuration problems - your agent can diagnose these with `openshell-cli`, `debug-openshell-cluster`, and `debug-inference`.
- "How do I..." requests — the skills cover CLI usage, policy generation, TUI development, and more.

## Agent Skills for Contributors

Skills live in `.agents/skills/`. Your agent's harness can discover and load them natively. Here is the full inventory:

### Workflow Chains

Skills connect into pipelines. Individual skill files don't describe these relationships.

- **Community inflow:** `triage-issue` → `create-spike` → `build-from-issue`
- **Internal development:** `create-spike` → `build-from-issue`
- **Security:** `review-security-issue` → `fix-security-issue`
- **Policy iteration:** `openshell-cli` → `generate-sandbox-policy`

## Prerequisites

Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). This is used to set up the development environment.

```bash
# Install mise (macOS/Linux)
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

After installing `mise`, activate it with `mise activate` or [add it to your shell](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).

Shell setup examples:

```bash
# Fish
echo '~/.local/bin/mise activate fish | source' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish

# Zsh
echo 'eval "$(~/.local/bin/mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Project requirements:

- Rust 1.88+
- Python 3.12+
- Docker (running)

## Getting Started

```bash
# One-time trust
mise trust

# Launch a sandbox (deploys a cluster if one isn't running)
mise run sandbox
```

## Building the `openshell` CLI

Inside this repository, `openshell` is a local shortcut script at `scripts/bin/openshell`. The script will

1. Build `openshell-cli` if needed.
2. Run the local debug CLI binary under `target/debug/openshell`.

Because `mise` adds `scripts/bin` to `PATH` for this project, you can run `openshell` directly from the repo.

```bash
openshell --help
openshell sandbox create -- codex
```

### Cluster debugging helpers

Two additional scripts in `scripts/bin/` provide gateway-aware wrappers for cluster debugging:

| Script | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `kubectl` | Runs `kubectl` inside the active gateway's k3s container via `openshell doctor exec` |
| `k9s` | Runs `k9s` inside the active gateway's k3s container via `openshell doctor exec` |

These work for both local and remote gateways (SSH is handled automatically). Examples:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl logs -n openshell statefulset/openshell
k9s
k9s -n openshell
```

## Main Tasks

These are the primary `mise` tasks for day-to-day development:

## Documentation

If your change affects user-facing behavior (new flags, changed defaults, new features, bug fixes that contradict existing docs), update the relevant pages under `docs/` in the same PR.

To ensure your doc changes follow NVIDIA documentation style, use the `update-docs` skill.
It scans commits, identifies doc pages that need updates, and drafts content that follows the style guide in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

To build and preview docs locally:

```bash
mise run docs # to build the docs locally
mise run docs:serve # to serve locally and automatically rebuild on changes
```

See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes with tests.
3. Run `mise run ci` to verify.
4. Open a PR using the `create-github-pr` skill or manually following the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
